## Hi there 👋
I'm Lillian Nakato Bagalya
Software Engineer | Django Developer | Full-Stack Learner | Tech Explorer
I’m driven by the quiet thrill of turning ideas into working systems — the kind that solve real problems for real people. My journey started with curiosity and grew into a passion for building applications that are clean, reliable, and a little bit delightful.
From crafting REST APIs to building digital tools for audits and inventory management, I love working on solutions that bring order, insight, and automation to everyday workflows.

🔭 I’m currently working on ICPAU Audit Tool – A secure, ISA-compliant audit documentation system built with Django + DRF
Karibu Grocery Inventory System – Sales tracking, stock management, and real-time analytics for a retail business
Inventory Management Web App – Automated stock deduction, receipt generation & store operations workflows
Personal Portfolio Website – Showcasing my projects, skills, and software engineering journey
